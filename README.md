# Prework - Daily Color

Submitted by: **Darian Lee**

Daily Color is an app that lets you click a button to find out what color you are that day (I anticipate this will out compete TikTok in terms of popularity)

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total (note: I was using an older version of xcode that is harder to use. I am getting a new laptop next month though)

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

I am using xcode version 10.1. It seems that every time you make a small change to the button,
the software crashes and you need to make a new file and rewrite everything from scratch. I didn't realise this at first and thought I must of had some bug somewhere.
Once I realised that the solution was to repaste my code into a new file whenever I changed something in order to prevent it from crashing, the process went a lot more smoothly

## App Brainstorming:

favorite apps:

Anki:
- simplicity
- usefullness
- lets you do most of the work
- no popups windows or otherwise annoying distractions 
Reverso Context:
- has links that let you copy and paste things, hear audio, or see translations for similar words
- pleasent, simple color pallete
- easy to use
- no popups windows or otherwise annoying distractions
Telegram:
- ability to customize the background screen
- animated emojis
My app ideas:
I really like language learning, and I want an app that can help you make flashcards for yourself or little quizzes. 
Ideally, the app would scrap a corpus site like reverso context and use that to create its own quiz questions based on the vocab words you provided. For example, 
if the user gave it the Turkish word itiraf (confess), it would find several examples from a corpus and create flash cards or quiz questions with sentences like
"Yaptigimi hatirlamadigim bir seyi ___ etmem" (I won't __ to something I don't remember doing)
